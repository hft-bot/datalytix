            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What Is an Agentic System?</h2>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              An agentic system is an AI-powered setup where autonomous agents can <strong>perceive, reason, and take action</strong> to achieve goals with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional AI models that only respond to prompts, agentic systems can:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              <li><strong>Plan:</strong> Break down goals into smaller, actionable steps.</li>
              <li><strong>Act:</strong> Interact with software, APIs, or devices to execute tasks.</li>
              <li><strong>Learn:</strong> Improve performance over time through feedback and adaptation.</li>
              <li><strong>Collaborate:</strong> Work alongside humans or other AI agents to complete workflows.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Why Agentic Systems Matter</h2>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              The power of agentic systems lies in their ability to bridge <strong>intelligence and execution</strong>. Instead of asking ChatGPT for marketing ideas and then manually setting up campaigns, you could have an agent that creates, schedules, and tracks those campaigns across tools like HubSpot, LinkedIn, or Salesforce.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              <li><strong>Automation at scale</strong> - Handle repetitive workflows without manual effort.</li>
              <li><strong>Decision-making support</strong> - Recommend and act on data-driven insights.</li>
              <li><strong>24/7 productivity</strong> - Agents never sleep, ensuring continuous execution.</li>
              <li><strong>Personalization</strong> - Adapt actions to individual users or customers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Agentic systems are already being applied across industries:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              <li><strong>Marketing & Sales:</strong> Managing LinkedIn outreach, syncing leads into CRM, and personalizing follow-ups.</li>
              <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> Multi-agent setups where one agent answers queries while another escalates complex issues.</li>
              <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Agents analyzing market data, executing trades, or flagging anomalies.</li>
              <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Virtual care coordinators scheduling appointments, tracking medication adherence, and reporting updates.</li>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Future of Agentic Systems</h2>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              We’re moving toward a world where teams of AI agents collaborate like humans, handling research, execution, and optimization across domains. Imagine having a digital workforce that seamlessly integrates with your existing tools, freeing human teams to focus on strategy, creativity, and relationships.
